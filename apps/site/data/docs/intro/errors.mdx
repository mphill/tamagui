### Warning 001

#### Ignorable modules

This error means the compiler can't bundle some dependencies into what it reads at compile-time in order to optimize. It's not necessarily an error and usually won't de-opt.

To disable the warning you can set:

```
TAMAGUI_IGNORE_BUNDLE_ERRORS=some_module_name,some_other_module_name
```

Or to disable them all (not recommended):

```
TAMAGUI_IGNORE_BUNDLE_ERRORS=true
```

To see a full stack trace:

```
TAMAGUI_SHOW_FULL_BUNDLE_ERRORS=true
```

When Tamagui has trouble running `require` on a module, it simply replaces it with a "proxy worm", basically a Proxy that just tries to return empty objects no matter when you try and de-structure from them. This is normally fine and avoids the compiler de-opting on "weird" modules.
